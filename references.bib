	abstract = {With Google’s Flutter framework continuing to grow in popularity for companies and developers alike, the need for an understanding of how to utilize the framework in a largescale context has become more relevant than ever. The purpose of this thesis is to document the crucial steps most development teams using Flutter in a large-scale application will face. Additionally, a fully documented, large-scale reference application was generated so that other developers may use it as an aid when creating their own Flutter projects on a similar scale. Multiple steps were taken to ensure that optimal solutions were chosen for each aspect of the development process. For each of those aspects, a wide range of possible solutions were explored, compared and analysed. Finally, one of the possible solutions was chosen based on a wide range of scientific papers and community-generated sources. Additionally, an interview with an expert in the field was conducted to further validate those decisions. After the application was fully implemented, ten crucial aspects of the development process were identified. Those ten aspects are now explained in detail in this thesis. Ultimately, the knowledge provided by this thesis can act as a map for peers using Flutter in a large-scale context and help them overcome the crossroads they will most likely come to face.},

But due to long queues at bill payment and checking place the customers get frustrated. Shop Go is a smart shopping solution which could help customer solve these problems using IoT. In this paper, a smart shopping solution has been implemented using IoT to solve few problems of customers to save their time. Firstly, all the shopping carts are afﬁxed with an RFID scanner and every product would be having an RFID tag attached to it. The microcontroller used for this whole system is Particle Photon. The second part of the system is a native mobile application which would be featuring a user interface where the customers could see what the products were brought and this is implemented using ﬁrebase as a back end. The payments for their products could be on the go using Razor pay payment gateway and also a Chatbot has been implemented using DialogFlow which would help to keep track of the items are likely to be brought, tell about the discounts available in-store and also gives information about where the items could be found in the supermarket.},

There are many survey papers about the cross-platform mobile development solutions but they do not include the most recent approaches, including Component-Based approach, Cloud-Based approach, and Merged approach. The main aim of this paper is helping the researchers to know the most recent approaches and the open research issues. This paper surveys the existing cross-platform mobile development approaches and attempts to provide a global view: it thoroughly introduces a comprehensive categorization to the cross-platform approaches, defines the pros and cons of each approach, explains sample solutions per approach, compares the cross-platform mobile development solutions, and ends with the open research areas.},

It relies on the fact that topological characteristics of a network leave traces in the evolution of a self-organized synchronization process. The preliminary results presented in this report show a promising detection accuracy and justify a further investigation of our approach.},

	abstract = {App development has gained importance since the advent of smartphones to enable the ubiquitous access to information. Until now, multior cross-platform approaches are usually limited to different platforms for smartphones and tablets. With the recent trend towards app-enabled mobile devices, a plethora of heterogeneous devices such as smartwatches and smart TVs continues to emerge. For app developers, the situation resembles the early days of smartphones but worsened by the widely differing hardware, platform capabilities, and usage patterns. In order to tackle the identified challenges of app development beyond the boundaries of individual device classes, a systematic process built on the model-driven paradigm is presented. In addition, we demonstrate its applicability using the MAML framework to create interoperable business apps for both smartphones and smartwatches from a common, platform-independent model.},

However, Flutter developers have to deal with a state management issue when developing their applications. In order to solve this problem, multiple architectures have been developed. This paper proposes a new Flutter architecture based on the Clean Architecture by Uncle Bob. The Flutter Clean Architecture proposed in this paper is packaged and released through a Flutter package. The architecture is tested by developing a full application from scratch using the package and documenting the process. The Flutter Clean Architecture provides a solution to the state management problem as well as a potential overall choice for Flutter mobile application architecture.},

	abstract = {Mochte man eine mobile Applikation fur ein mobiles Betriebssystem entwickeln, so programmiert und kompiliert man diese mit dem jeweiligen SDK der Plattform und hinterlegt sie dann in dem jeweiligen App Store. Um sich den Aufwand der mehrfachen Entwicklung fur die unterschiedlichen Plattformen zu sparen, entwickelt man eine Cross-Plattform-Anwendung, also eine Anwendung, die unabhangig vom Betriebssystem des mobilen Endgerates ist. Dafur gibt es inzwischen verschiedene Frameworks, die diese Entwicklungsmoglichkeit unterstutzen. Einige davon werden in dieser Arbeit vorgestellt. Diese Arbeit behandelt die Entwicklung einer plattformunabhangigen Applikation fur mobile Endgerate anhand eines solchen Frameworks. Als Anwendungszenario wurde eine Tourismus-Applikation gewahlt, welche als Client Informationen wie Nachrichten, Veranstaltungen, Burgermeldungen und Sehenswurdigkeiten abruft und auf dem mobilen Endgerat des Nutzers darstellt. Serverseitig wird hierzu eine REST - API benotigt, die den Zugriff auf die bereits bestehende Datenbank regelt, in welcher die Daten fur die einzelnen Kommunen vorliegen. Die Entwicklung der REST-Schnittstelle ist ebenfalls Gegenstand dieser Arbeit. Anschliesend wird die Cross-Plattform-Entwicklung vorgestellt. 
 
Im Fazit der Arbeit lasst sich feststellen, dass eine solche plattformunabhangige Entwicklung viele Vorteile mit sich bringt und diese auch in der nachsten Zeit noch zunehmen werden, andererseits wird jedoch vieles dennoch weiterhin mit nativen Applikationen programmiert werden, da solche Cross-Plattform-Entwicklungsmoglichkeiten noch lange nicht an die Performance und die Moglichkeiten der nativen Entwicklung herankommen werden.},

	abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) shall be able to incorporate transparently and seamlessly a large number of different and heterogeneous end systems, while providing open access to selected subsets of data for the development of a plethora of digital services. Building a general architecture for the IoT is hence a very complex task, mainly because of the extremely large variety of devices, link layer technologies, and services that may be involved in such a system. In this paper, we focus specifically to an urban IoT system that, while still being quite a broad category, are characterized by their specific application domain. Urban IoTs, in fact, are designed to support the Smart City vision, which aims at exploiting the most advanced communication technologies to support added-value services for the administration of the city and for the citizens. This paper hence provides a comprehensive survey of the enabling technologies, protocols, and architecture for an urban IoT. Furthermore, the paper will present and discuss the technical solutions and best-practice guidelines adopted in the Padova Smart City project, a proof-of-concept deployment of an IoT island in the city of Padova, Italy, performed in collaboration with the city municipality.},

	abstract = {When JUnit was first introduced a decade ago by Kent Beck and Erich Gamma, the Agile movement was in its infancy, "Test Driven Development" was unknown, and unit testing was just starting to move into the typical developer's vocabulary. Today, most developers acknowledge the benefits of unit testing and rely on the increasingly sophisticated tools now available. The recently released JUnit 4.5 represents the state of the art in unit testing frameworks, and provides significant new features to improve the Java development process.JUnit in Action, Second Edition is an up-to-date guide to unit testing Java applications (including Java EE applications) using the JUnit framework and its extensions. This book provides techniques for solving real-world problems such as testing AJAX applications, using mocks to achieve testing isolation, in-container testing for Java EE and database applications, and test automation.Written to help readers exploit JUnit 4.5, the book covers recent innovations such as the new annotations that simplify test writing, improved exception handling, and the new assertion methods. You'll also discover how to use JUnit extensions to test new application styles and frameworks including Ajax, OSGi, and HTML-based presentation layers.Using a sample-driven approach, various unit testing strategies are covered, such as how to unit test EJBs, database applications, and web applications. Also addressed are testing strategies using freely available open source frameworks and tools, and how to unit test in isolation with Mock Objects. The book will also bring you up to speed on the latest thinking in TDD, BDD, Continuous Integration, and other practices related to unit testing. Purchase of the print book comes with an offer of a free PDF, ePub, and Kindle eBook from Manning. Also available is all code from the book.},

Cross-platform development might alleviate this situation. Several cross-platform approaches have emerged, which we classify in a first step. In order to compare concrete cross-platform solutions, we compiled a set of criteria to assess cross-platform development approaches. Based on these criteria, we evaluated Web apps, apps developed with PhoneGap or Titanium Mobile, and – for comparison – natively developed apps. We present our findings as reference tables and generalize our results. Our criteria have proven to be viable for follow-up evaluations. With regard to the approaches, we found PhoneGap viable if very close resemblance to a native look \& feel can be neglected.},

	abstract = {The extensive growth and expansion of smartphones and tablets and therewith the use of mobile web applications that utilize HTML5 and related technologies are frequently discussed and debated in media as possible replacements for native applications. The aim of this study was to explore the viability of replacing native applications with mobile web applications in a developing country setting. Two mobile web applications were developed. The first mobile web application tracked runs and the second mobile web application was a booking system for scheduling â??slum runsâ?.  The subjects who tested these apps were elite, semi-professional Kenyan runners primarily from the Kibera slum area outside of Nairobi. After a 6-month test period the participants concluded and results indicated that the mobile web application for tracking runs performed poorly compared to native applications due to poor GPS performance, while the mobile web application for booking slum runs performed well. The conclusion from this study is that mobile web applications that require hardware interaction such as using the GPS, GPU, or camera are not yet viable alternatives for native applications. However, mobile applications that only require a native interface and content consumption are suitable substitutes for native applications.},

	abstract = {MQTT is a Client Server publish/subscribe messaging transport protocol. It is light weight, open, simple, and designed so as to be easy to implement. These characteristics make it ideal for use in many situations, including constrained environments such as for communication in Machine to Machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) contexts where a small code footprint is required and/or network bandwidth is at a premium. The protocol runs over TCP/IP, or over other network protocols that provide ordered, lossless, bi-directional connections. Its features include: · Use of the publish/subscribe message pattern which provides one-to-many message distribution and decoupling of applications. · A messaging transport that is agnostic to the content of the payload. · Three qualities of service for message delivery: · "At most once", where messages are delivered according to the best efforts of the operating environment. Message loss can occur. This level could be used, for example, with ambient sensor data where it does not matter if an individual reading is lost as the next one will be published soon after. · "At least once", where messages are assured to arrive but duplicates can occur. · "Exactly once", where message are assured to arrive exactly once. This level could be used, for example, with billing systems where duplicate or lost messages could lead to incorrect charges being applied. · A small transport overhead and protocol exchanges minimized to reduce network traffic. · A mechanism to notify interested parties when an abnormal disconnection occurs.},

	abstract = {Accident investigation and analysis are key to reinforcing and improving railway safety. Many railway accidents have been caused by degraded human performance and human error, and the tasks of train drivers and signalers have remained essentially the same. Although new technologies and equipment have gradually reduced railway operation accidents, no investigation has been conducted to investigate whether railway performance shaping factors (R-PSFs), attributed to degraded human performance, have changed or remained constant. Focusing on UK railways, this paper analyzes railway accidents involving human error for the period 1945 to 2012. The purpose of the analysis is twofold: to identify whether the number and type of factors that affect human performance and contribute to human errors have changed during this period and to assess the quality of data collected by investigation reports and to determine whether the collection of such data has evolved and improved. The analysis identifies the number of R-PSFs and their relationship to such variables as responsible personnel, immediate causes, and the time and location of the event. The contribution of those variables to the severity of an accident is calculated. Moreover, any changes in trends and patterns in the number of R-PSFs over time are explored through smoothing techniques of time series analysis. Finally, the quality of the collected data is analyzed with the data quality index. Results show that data investigation and data collection have significantly improved. However, although accident rates have decreased, the average number and type of factors that affect human performance have remained the same.},
